description: Create or refine the canonical project-level Product Requirements Document (`specs/prd.md`)
---

Create or refine the canonical project Product Requirements Document only. Ignore feature-level implementation context.

## Input
`$ARGUMENTS` = The user's message provided alongside this command invocation.
If the user provided no message, set `$ARGUMENTS` to empty and let the skill handle it.

Load and follow the workflow in `.github/skills/product-document/SKILL.md`.

When the shared workflow asks the user to choose or answer:
- Ask the user explicitly in chat and wait for the reply before continuing.
- Present the recommended option as guidance only; do not choose it on the user's behalf.
- Allow free-form answers anywhere the shared workflow allows them.
- Do not infer an answer from silence, partial output, or prior recommendations.

Do not browse ad hoc. Only when the workflow says **Delegate: Technical Researcher**, read `.github/agents/_technical-researcher.md` at that point and perform only that delegated step.

Report milestone progress.
