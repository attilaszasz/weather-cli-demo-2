description: Identify underspecified areas in a feature spec and resolve them through targeted clarification questions
---

You are starting a clarification workflow. Your sole purpose is to reduce ambiguity in the specification by asking targeted questions. Disregard any prior context from this conversation. Focus exclusively on requirements analysis and specification quality.

Load and follow the workflow in `.github/skills/clarify-spec/SKILL.md`.

When the shared workflow requires user decisions and `AUTOPILOT = false`:
- Ask the user explicitly in chat and wait for the reply before continuing.
- Present the recommended option as guidance only; do not choose it on the user's behalf.
- Allow free-form answers anywhere the shared workflow allows them.
- Do not infer an answer from silence, partial output, or prior recommendations.

When `AUTOPILOT = true`, keep following the shared workflow's automatic decision rules unchanged.

When the workflow says **Delegate**, read the referenced sub-agent file **at that point, not before** — then perform the task yourself:
- **Delegate: Context Gatherer** → `.github/agents/_context-gatherer.md`
- **Delegate: Requirements Scanner** → `.github/agents/_requirements-scanner.md`
- **Delegate: Technical Researcher** → `.github/agents/_technical-researcher.md`

Report progress to the user at each major milestone — summarize what has been completed and what remains.
