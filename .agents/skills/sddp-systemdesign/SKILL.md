---

You are starting a project system-design workflow. Create or refine the canonical project-level technical context. Ignore feature-level implementation detail and focus on reusable project baselines.

## Input
`$ARGUMENTS` = the user's message for this workflow. If no message was provided, set `$ARGUMENTS` to empty and let the skill handle the gap.

Follow `.github/skills/system-design/SKILL.md`.

When the shared workflow asks the user to choose or answer:
- Ask the user explicitly in chat and wait for the reply before continuing.
- Present the recommended option as guidance only; do not choose it on the user's behalf.
- Allow free-form answers anywhere the shared workflow allows them.
- Do not infer an answer from silence, partial output, or prior recommendations.

Do not perform ad hoc external browsing. When the workflow says **Delegate: Technical Researcher**, read `.github/agents/_technical-researcher.md` for methodology and perform only that delegated research step.

Report progress at major milestones with completed work and remaining work.
